        I use Affogato for legal research. As a lawyer, I want the best
        proofreading possible. As no model is perfect, having all of them is a
        gift! Love Affogato!

        Startups move fast - we can't afford downtime switching between AI
        tools. Affogato gives us everything: Claude for architecture decisions,
        GPT for rapid prototyping, Gemini for creative problem-solving. One
        interface, all models, fraction of the cost. Our AI budget dropped 70%.
        No-brainer for any tech team.

        Different models, different strengths, different product stages. Claude
        handles technical specs, GPT writes UX copy, Gemini nails market
        positioning. The transition between development phases is seamless now -
        one conversation, multiple expert perspectives. Product briefs went from
        fragmented to cohesive overnight.

        Okay, so I asked all three models the same brainstorming question and
        got three COMPLETELY different creative directions. Instead of picking
        one, I combined them all. Best campaign we've ever run came from this
        happy accident! Sometimes the best discoveries happen when you're not
        even trying üòÑ

        Have you ever been in a situation where you need to use multiple AI
        tools to get the job done? I have. It's a pain. Affogato is a great
        solution for that. It's so easy to use and the results are amazing. I'm
        so glad I found it!
