# Google Meet Recording & Transcription: Big Picture Plan

## 1. Meeting Recording Trigger

- Allow users to mark meetings for recording in the UI.
- Persist this flag in the database, associated with the meeting.

## 2. Google Meet Bot/Agent

- Develop or integrate a bot that can join Google Meet calls as a participant.
- Handle Google authentication securely for the bot.

## 3. Video/Audio Capture

- Record the meetingâ€™s audio (and optionally video) once the bot joins.
- Store the recording in a secure storage location (cloud or local).

## 4. Transcription

- Send the recorded audio to a transcription service (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper, AssemblyAI).
- Receive and process the transcription result.

## 5. Data Storage & Display

- Save the transcription to your database, linked to the meeting record.
- Display the transcription in the meeting details page.

## 6. Error Handling & Compliance

- Handle failures gracefully (bot join, recording, transcription errors).
- Notify users of the recording/transcription status.
- Ensure legal compliance and user consent for recording meetings.
