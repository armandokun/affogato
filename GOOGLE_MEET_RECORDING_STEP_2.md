# Step 2: Google Meet Bot/Agent (Detailed Breakdown)

## Goal

Develop or integrate a bot that can programmatically join Google Meet calls as a participant and handle the necessary authentication.

## Steps

1. **Research Bot Solutions**

   - Evaluate existing solutions (Puppeteer with headless Chrome, Google Meet API limitations, third-party services)
   - Consider services like:
     - Recall.ai (meeting bot API)
     - AssemblyAI Universal-2 with bot capabilities
     - Custom Puppeteer solution
     - Google Meet Add-ons (limited capabilities)

2. **Choose Implementation Approach**

   - **Option A**: Third-party service (Recall.ai, etc.) - easier but ongoing costs
   - **Option B**: Custom Puppeteer bot - more control but complex
   - **Option C**: Google Meet Add-on - limited but official

3. **Bot Authentication Setup**

   - Create a dedicated Google account for the bot (if using custom solution)
   - Set up OAuth2 credentials for the bot
   - Handle Google Workspace permissions if needed
   - Store bot credentials securely in environment variables

4. **Bot Joining Logic**

   - Implement function to extract meeting ID/URL from calendar events
   - Create bot join workflow:
     - Navigate to meeting URL
     - Handle meeting lobby/waiting room
     - Join with appropriate permissions (muted, camera off)
     - Handle potential security prompts

5. **Bot Management**

   - Track active bot sessions
   - Handle bot disconnections/rejoining
   - Implement bot leave logic when meeting ends
   - Monitor bot health and status

6. **Integration with Step 1**

   - Query database for meetings with `recording_requested = true`
   - Schedule bot to join these meetings at the appropriate time
   - Update meeting status when bot joins/leaves

7. **Error Handling**
   - Handle meeting access denied scenarios
   - Deal with network issues during bot operation
   - Implement retry logic for failed join attempts
   - Log bot activities for debugging

## Technical Considerations

- **Rate Limits**: Google Meet may have limits on automated access
- **Detection**: Google may detect and block automated bots
- **Compliance**: Ensure bot announces recording (legal requirement in many jurisdictions)
- **Scalability**: Consider how many concurrent meetings the bot can handle

## Recommended Starting Point

Start with a third-party service like **Recall.ai** for MVP:

- Faster implementation
- Handles complex browser automation
- Built-in recording capabilities
- Can transition to custom solution later

Next steps: Choose implementation approach and set up initial bot infrastructure.
